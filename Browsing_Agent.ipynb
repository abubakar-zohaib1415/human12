Messi’s play continued to rapidly improve over the years, and by 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world, finishing second to Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 Ballon d’Or. At the 2014 World Cup, Messi put on a dazzling display, scoring four goals and almost single-handedly propelling an offense-deficient Argentina team through the group stage and into the knockout rounds, where Argentina then advanced to the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. After Argentina was defeated in the Copa final—the team’s third consecutive finals loss in a major tournament—Messi said that he was quitting the national team, but his short-lived “retirement” lasted less than two months before he announced his return to the Argentine team. Messi helped Barcelona capture another treble during the 2014–15 season, leading the team with 43 goals scored over the course of the campaign, which resulted in his fifth world player of the year honour.', 'score': 0.56460327, 'raw_content': None}, {'title': 'Lionel Messi - Wikipedia', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi', 'content': 'He scored twice in the last group match, a 3–2 victory over Nigeria, his second goal coming from a free kick, as they finished first in their group.[423] Messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1–0 win against Switzerland in the round of 16, and played in the 1–0 quarter-final win against Belgium as Argentina progressed to the semi-final of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.[424][425] Following a 0–0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the Netherlands 4–2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with Messi scoring his team\\'s first penalty.[426]\\nBilled as Messi versus Germany, the world\\'s best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring Diego Maradona.[427] Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. \"[582] Moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including Maradona, questioned Messi\\'s leadership with Argentina at times, despite his playing ability.[583][584][585] Vickery states the perception of Messi among Argentines changed in 2019, with Messi making a conscious effort to become \"more one of the group, more Argentine\", with Vickery adding that following the World Cup victory in 2022 Messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as Maradona.[581]\\nComparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo\\nAmong his contemporary peers, Messi is most often compared and contrasted with Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing, the Roger Federer–Rafael Nadal rivalry in tennis, and the Prost–Senna rivalry from Formula One motor racing.[586][587]\\nAlthough Messi has at times denied any rivalry,[588][589] they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world.[160] Since 2008, Messi has won eight Ballons d\\'Or to Ronaldo\\'s five,[590] seven FIFA World\\'s Best Player awards to Ronaldo\\'s five, and six European Golden Shoes to Ronaldo\\'s four.[591] Pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players.[160][592] On 11 July, Messi provided his 20th assist of the league season for Arturo Vidal in a 1–0 away win over Real Valladolid, equalling Xavi\\'s record of 20 assists in a single La Liga season from 2008 to 2009;[281][282] with 22 goals, he also became only the second player ever, after Thierry Henry in the 2002–03 FA Premier League season with Arsenal (24 goals and 20 assists), to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single league season in one of Europe\\'s top-five leagues.[282][283] Following his brace in a 5–0 away win against Alavés in the final match of the season on 20 May, Messi finished the season as both the top scorer and top assist provider in La Liga, with 25 goals and 21 assists respectively, which saw him win his record seventh Pichichi trophy, overtaking Zarra; however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[284] On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini\\'s record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez\\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\\nDespite Messi\\'s individual form, Barcelona\\'s four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club\\'s history – drew to an end.[131] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara\\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[164]', 'score': 0.5582553, 'raw_content': None}, {'title': 'Lionel Messi Biography - Facts, Childhood, Family Life & Achievements', 'url': 'https://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/lionel-messi-5242.php', 'content': \"Lionel Messi has won multiple FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, numerous La Liga titles with FC Barcelona, and holds the record for most goals scored in a calendar year.
